# EasyModbusTCP.NET

This is a fork of [GitHub - rossmann-engineering/EasyModbusTCP.NET: Modbus TCP, Modbus UDP and Modbus RTU client/server library for .NET implementations](https://github.com/rossmann-engineering/EasyModbusTCP.NET)



we are using the GUI Tool ***EasyModbusAdvancedClient*** for testing modbus TCP

* this tool is modified as it was missing some features
